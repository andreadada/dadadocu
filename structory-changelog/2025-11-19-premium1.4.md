### New Features Requested by `@Silentassassin9`
- Added new Crafting system to allow different types of crafting, called listeners.  at the moment there are `manual` and `entity-death` which will trigger a craft event
- Add new section to Crafting option to register new listeners
```YAML
options:
  crafting:
    listeners:
      entity-death: 
        range: 15
      interact: {} #if none specified, this is the only one
```
- Now Recipes can be assigned to different Triggers (Listeners), by default they are assigned to Interact listener.
```YAML
nether_star: # Ingredient
  name: nether_star
  display_name: "Nether Star"
  listeners:
    - entity-death
#   - interact
```
- 2 new Ingredients: 1) `killedentity` which is used to add conditions to the killed entity (if entity death event). 2) `entity` Check nearby entities, names, types and other conditions
- Check the wiki for more details
