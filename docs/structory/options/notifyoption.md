# üì¢ Notify Option

## What is the Notify Option?

The `notify` option lets you send messages or visual notifications to the player when a structure is created. You can display chat messages, action bar text, and even titles with fade effects.

This is useful for giving feedback, storytelling, or simply making your structures feel more interactive and alive.
